# Vision

This frontend starter is intended to be a production-grade template for customer-facing web applications. Its objectives:

- Provide clear, opinionated structure (feature-oriented, domain-driven folders).
- Ship fast while enforcing code quality (linting, formatting, CI gates).
- Be easy to onboard to: clear scripts, local dev container options and documentation.
- Scale: support multiple features, pages, and maintainable domain entities.

We favor pragmatic defaults, automated checks and simple deployable artifacts (static build served with nginx). Keep the template minimal, well-documented and extendable.
