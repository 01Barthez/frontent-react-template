# Project Documentation

This `docs/` folder is the single entry point for all project documentation. It is organized to help engineers, product managers, and maintainers understand the why, how and rules that govern this frontend repository.

Structure (high level)

- `architecture/` — rationale and architecture diagrams.
- `guidelines/` — non-negotiable rules and coding standards.
- `onboarding/` — fast path to get productive locally and ship a first feature.
- `features/` — product-oriented documentation for each feature domain.
- `entities/` — business contracts and domain model for core entities.
- `api/` — frontend/backend API contract, conventions and error handling.
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting major choices.

Read this file first then follow the links to the section you need. Keep docs concise, up-to-date and linked to PRs or ADRs when decisions change.
