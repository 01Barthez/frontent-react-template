# Folder structure

High-level folders (what they mean):

- `src/app` — application bootstrap, global providers, routes.
- `src/entities` — domain models, api schemas, mappers.
- `src/features` — feature verticals with `ui/`, `model/`, `api/` subfolders.
- `src/shared` — components, ui primitives, hooks, api client, styles.
- `widgets` — small composite components used across pages.

Keep folders small and dedicated. If a folder grows beyond 200 lines per file, consider splitting.
